# dllist
This is a simple Doubly Linked List header that you can include in your proyect under the GPL 3+ licence conditions. Please take a look at main.c to see an example that shows how to use this header. As dllist handles all kind of structures using void* pointers, you need to define a *print* function, a *comparision* function and a *free* functions, in order to work with it.
